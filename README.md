py-enigma: an enigma machine simulator
============================================
Inspired by The Imitation Game  
A Python enigma script that allows encryption and decryption based on randomly generated plugboards, rotors and reflector that accurately simulates how the enigma works. Even accounts for the unique double-stepping of the rotors!
  
  
  
Usage: python enigma.py  
 Commands:  
 new          => resets the machine configuration  
 reset        => resets the machine rotors for decryption  
 encrypt "plaintext" => encrypts the given plaintext  
 decrypt "ciphertext" => decrypts the given ciphertext   
 print        => prints the current setup of the enigma  
 help         => prints this message  
 exit         => exits the script
